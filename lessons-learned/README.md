<!-- This was my first project. 

Here the goal was to use the CSS to style the page and use the correct tags in the HTML.

Requirements:
- Use a specific background colour.
- Fixed menu.
- Add a photo.
- Make an ordinated list and an unordered one.
- Add a footer.
- Add external links.
- Create an article.
- Create an aside.
- Correctly use the tags; "article", "header", "nav", "section", "aside", "footer".
- Get approved by CodeSniffer.
- Add a table.(I've hidden it around the image)
- Use Box Model.
- Change text attributes.
- Put article and aside next to each other. -->
